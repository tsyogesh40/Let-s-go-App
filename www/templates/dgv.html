Chronicle :<br>
The green valley View is formerly called as Suicide Point. It received its name because of the dangerous valley which is deep and dense. The valley below the point is more than 5000 feet drop. The best time to visit the Valley View is between 10 am and 3 pm as the valley gets covered by mist as the day advances making it difficult to have a clear view.<br>
