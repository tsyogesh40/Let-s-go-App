Chronicle:<br>The church is located at a distance of over 70 km from the city, but is well worth the extra effort. The church is in the shape of a boat. This is so because, the town where it is located, Uvari, mainly thrives on fishing as a source of income. The church is dedicated to St. Mary and is by the seashore.<br>
