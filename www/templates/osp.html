Chronicle :<br>
A number of Bollywood, Tamil and Malayalam movies were shot across Ooty. Some of the well-known movies like Dil, Maine Pyar Kiya, Ajab Prem ki Gazab Kahani had some of their prominent songs and visuals shot across the major tourist attractions in Ooty. These were shot along the Ooty Lake that spreads across 65 acres of the land in Ooty. The railway line and the eucalyptus trees that cover the lake are picturesque and cannot be missed. Boating Facilities are available along the lakes.
