Chronicle :<br>
The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a railway in Tamil Nadu, India, built by the British in 1908,[1] and was initially operated by the Madras Railway. The railway relies on its fleet of steam locomotives.[2] NMR comes under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Salem Division.<br>

In July 2005, UNESCO added the Nilgiri Mountain Railway as an extension to the World Heritage Site of Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the site then became known as "Mountain Railways of India"[3] after it satisfied the necessary criteria, thus forcing abandonment of the modernisation plans.<br>

For the past several years diesel locomotives have taken over from steam on the section between Coonoor and Udhagamandalam. Local people and tourists have led a demand for steam locomotives to once again haul this section.<br><br>
