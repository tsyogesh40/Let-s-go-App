Chronicle :<br>Thanjavur Art Gallery, also known as Tanjore Art Gallery, is sited in Thanjavur or Tanjore in Tamil Nadu. The gallery was built in the beautiful Thanjavur Royal Palace of the Nayaks built in 1600 A.D. 
The walls of the art gallery adorn painting and sculptures of South India that prevailed during the peak of the Tamil history. Most of the artefacts and relics in the Thanjavur Art Gallery were recovered from the Chola Dynasty between the 9th and the 13th century A.D, the Nayak Dynasty between 17th and 18th century A.D and through the Pallava period that followed.
