	Ubbalamudugu Falls (also called Tada Falls) is a waterfall located to the North of Oneness Temple and Sricity in the Chittoor district of India. Coming under the Buchinaidu kandriga and Varadaiahpalem mandals the falls are located 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Chennai and 35 kilometres (22 mi) from Srikalahasti.
The falls are located in a forest called the Siddulaiah Kona. The relation to Lord Shiva ensures that the festival of Maha Shivaratri is a common time for people to visit.
