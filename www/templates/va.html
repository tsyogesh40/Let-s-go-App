Auroville Beach - popularly referred to as Auro beach - as the name suggests is close to Auroville. It is situated at the right side of the ECR, opposite to the road leading to Auroville. Located about 12 kms from the main Puducherry town, its shallow waters and small waves make it an ideal place for swimming. It is a fairly popular destination and on weekends it can get rather crowded, whereas on weekdays it is relatively less so.
