	Chronicle :<br>siruvani Waterfalls and the dam named after them are located 35 km (22 mi) west of Coimbatore in the Western Ghats. The reservoir at Siruvani was built for Tamil Nadu by the Kerala government with funds collected by the Tamil Nadu government to meet the drinking water requirements of Coimbatore. The gateways on either side of the road across the dam are typical of the Kerala and Tamil architectural styles. Siruvani is also home to certain tribals like the Mudugars and Irulars. Water from Siruvani River is renowned for its taste and mineral properties, and the view from the falls and the dam is a tourist attraction
