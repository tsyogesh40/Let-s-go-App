Chronicle :<br>
Mangala Devi Kannagi temple is a historic temple located on the border of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, about 7 km from Pazhiyankudi in Theni district and 15 km from Thekkady in Idukki district. Cheran Chenguttuvan, the king of ancient Tamilakam, had erected the temple for Kannagi around 2000 years back at Vannathiparai and called it 'Kannagi Kottam' or 'Mangaladevi Kannagi temple' and performed regular pujas. It sits at an altitude of about 1,337 m (4,386 ft) above the mean sea level. It is surrounded by lush greenery and is closed throughout the year except during the Chitra Pournami festival. At other times tourists can still view it by getting a special letter from the forest ranger. The view<br><br>
